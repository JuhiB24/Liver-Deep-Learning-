# Liver-Deep-Learning-
The method analyzes microscopy images of human liver biopsies stained in Masson' Trichrome or Goldner stain. As result the four features of the pathologist-based Kleiner score (Statosis, Ballooning, Inflammation and Fibrosis) are generated. The features are in the identical numerical range as the pathologist score (e.g. 0-4 for fibrosis) but on a continuous scale.
